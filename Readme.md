### Hello there! This is a small game developed by me for my course assignment. Read the instructions here and try out the game. I hope you like it :)  


### Gameplay and Rules :  

The game has two rounds, each round consists of both the players playing once against each other. 

Player 1 is at bottom and has to reach the other end by avoiding all the obstacles and in minimum time.  

Player 2 starts at the top of the screen and has to reach the bottom, the other objectives remain the same.  
As the player crosses a band, he/she is rewarded points according to the number of obstacles in that band, the rules are –   
1. +5 for fixed obstacles  
1. +10 for moving obstacles  

The player with the greater score wins that particular round, score decreases as time passes.Time penalty is 1 point for 2 seconds. 

In the next round, the speed of the moving obstacles increases for the winner of the previous round.  
 
The game automatically closes after the second round.
